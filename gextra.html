									<p>Azarieh street is situated in Ashrafieh. You find people of all ages, yet it’s not for everyone. Old women well-dressed with their French accent, walking around Azarieh street. Some live in dorms. These sector living in dorms talk about their children successful stories, that they’re working in countries outside Lebanon. They believe that their children are coming back. Though their eyes are filled with sorrow, yet they cover it with prestige. They do not accept the clear truth that the children are not returning and that there is a reason for them to be put in dorms. </p>
								  <p>Other people (25-35 of age, single) wake up early in the morning around 6:00 am to take their daily jog before work; perfect timing before student of Azarieh School nearby, arrive. Not forgetting the other sector of people that also live in dorms, some are university students others are single women/men workers. Azarieh street is also filled with buildings surrounding it some are old others are new, both are filled with residence. However, Azarieh Street still manage to keep a quiet neighborhood early in the morning and late afternoon. </p>
								  <p>Azarieh School takes up approximately most of Azarieh Street. Like any other streets will neighboring schools, people living there get to engage with different actions; Sound of the bill ringing at 8:00 am, children reciting the Lebanese anthem before entering classes, and most importantly the chaotic traffic that takes place between 2:00 pm till 3:30 pm, when students are going home. These action take place during weekdays excluding the weekends. </p>
								  <p>At night the street is very calm and quiet, minimal cars pass by, light isn’t found all over the azarieh, the only light source provided by the street is found only when you are moving closer to the school. Shops around the azarieh streets start to close around 8:30 pm, except the glossary store (facing the Azarieh school from the other main gate) closes at 10:30 pm. Safety here starts to fade. Even though Azarieh Street is surrounded with two different religious dorms one related to Roam Catholic church to Maronite. Both are situated facing each other. (The Maronite dorms are related to the Azarieh School). Ironically, safety is very minimal, both dorm sector do not provide safety team for the building. Especially on Sundays where the shops surrounding Azarieh street closes. However, you still see people walking around Azarieh Street. Mostly dog owners walk their dogs; (or their house hold maid) Coming back from work and university, some people of ages 20 to 40 jog around the Azarieh streets, and other go to the gym, which is found inside azarieh school. Azrieh street is surrounded with pedestrian pathway, yet people don’t use it because of the dog waste found at every block. So people prefer to walk or jog on car passage. This makes movement around Azarieh street risky.</p>
								  <p>Azarieh Street is not for everyone. Knowing that this street is filled with Christian culture, not everyone can enter there. That is you expect a Nun to pass by Azrieh Street, but not veiled women. Moreover veiled student or worker is not accepted by any religious dorms. These dorms do not accept them to rent a room. This is clearly discrimination. As well as only the Christian sector get to own houses not any other religion.</p>
									<p>Azarieh street was never a business sector, that is it never had dorms. It is owned by Lebanese Batrak, who decided to make Azariah street a place of education and to help the people with disabilities and handicap. Later on an organization called “You are my brother” establishes in Azarieh, helping people with disabilities. It then changed to a small indoor school offering living for the orphans. However, they wanted to make profit. So, They turned this space from being inclusive and for everyone to a business project that provides indoor dorms for students and workers. </p>
									<p>Azareih Street can also be a land mark, since the famous frencg peot “la martine” had a house there. He gave this property to his daughter Julia. This house witnessed her julias death. To make this place memorial the French ambassador lifted a memorial plate, explaining the historical incident. Sadly, this place no longer exists now. It was removed 3 years ago. </p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>From these words, I have developed the ideas into design. By illustrating the history of this land, and displaying the quotes from the people that lived there and had a bad experience.</p>
